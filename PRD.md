## 1. Executive Summary
**1.1 Vision Statement**
PairUp is a free, AI-powered social platform for food and beverage pairing. It covers wine, beer, spirits, cocktails, ciders, and non-alcoholic alternatives.

**1.2 Key Differentiators**
* **AI-Powered Reviews:** Image recognition + grounded search validates experiences vs brand claims.
* **Voice & Video First:** Short, snappy video reviews and voice notes.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** We build a proprietary "Global Taste Graph" based on real user preference data.
* **Meta Ecosystem Integration:** Seamless cross-posting to Instagram/Facebook.

**1.3 Business Model**
* **Affiliate Commissions:** From merchant purchase links.
* **Data Monetization (B2B):** Selling aggregated, anonymized consumer taste reports.
